This directory contains the GNU diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp utilities.
Their features are a superset of the Unix features and they are
significantly faster.

See the file COPYING for copying conditions.
See the file diff.texi (or diff.info*) for documentation that can be printed
	with TeX, or read with the `info' program or with Emacs's `M-x info'.
	There are no man pages.
See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.

The `configure' command has special options to work around bugs
in some buggy file systems:

  configure --with-mvfs-stat-bug
    Work around ClearCase MVFS bug id ATRia04618.

  configure --with-nfs-stat-bug
    Work around a buggy NFS servers that assign the same
    (device number, inode number) pair to two distinct files.

    This bug can occur with Linux NFS servers
    that export all local filesystems as a single NFS filesystem,
    if a local device number (st_dev) exceeds 255,
    or if a local inode number (st_ino) exceeds 16777215.

    This bug also can occur with Network Appliance NFS servers
    in snapshot directories; see Netapp bug#1780.
